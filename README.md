# Spot-Crime

To provide the community driven platform by providing the ability to report the crime type at a particular which report can be directly added inside the real world database made using the Tableau visualization tool.

**Motivation**

1. Limitations of Current Solutions
- Lack of interactivity and limited community involvement.

2. Vision
- To create a more interactive and community-driven platform focused on
Los Angeles.
- Empower residents to actively participate in crime reporting, fostering
real-time awareness and prevention.

**Objective**

- To develop a community-driven
platform that enables users to report
crime types at specific locations, with
the submitted reports directly
integrated into a real-time database,
visualized using Tableau for enhanced
crime awareness and prevention.

**Tech Stacks**

**How the Web App works**
-So basically user can enter the description about the crime and choose the category of crime activity they noticed in the forum. They need to enter time and location where they witneesed the crime.

-When they enter the forum they will also see past crimes committed within one mile radius near to the location they entered. If other people noticed, they can upvote the crime. If the user gets more than 5 upvote or if the category of that crime in that area is top 5 crimes in terms of frequency then his/her crime will be displayed on the map. Else it will be there in the discussion forum and the crime will not be displayed on the map.

- User can also filter crimes by the time of day, category of crimes and (Month,Year) on the map for visualisation.

**Future Scope**
1. Expansion to Other Cities
- Scale the platform to cover additional urban areas beyond Los Angeles.

2. Predictive Analytics
- Implement machine learning algorithms to predict crime hotspots based
on trends.

3. Mobile Application Development
- Create mobile apps for easier, on-the-go crime reporting and real-time
updates.
